# Mobile jenkins shared library

Jenkins [shared library](https://jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/shared-libraries/)
to build Android, iOS and React Native apps.

## Installation

You can configure in Jenkins [global](https://jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/shared-libraries/#global-shared-libraries),
or using [CloudBees Folders Plugin](https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/CloudBees+Folders+Plugin) you can configure
for [folder level](https://jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/shared-libraries/#folder-level-shared-libraries).

## Usage

### Project requirements

#### Android
* [gradle wrapper](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/gradle_wrapper.html)
* Android SDK
* Android emulator or connected device
* set correct path to android sdk in [AndroidUtilities.groovy](https://github.com/mgasiorowski/mobile-jenkins-shared-library/blob/master/src/io/jenkins/mobilePipeline/AndroidUtilities.groovy#L12) ([Issue](https://github.com/mgasiorowski/mobile-jenkins-shared-library/issues/4))

#### iOS
* [fastlane](https://github.com/fastlane/fastlane)
* Xcode

### Jenkinsfile

To build your projects with this library, you must have Jenkinsfile in you repository, and configure Jenkins to use it 
(you can have more than one Jenkinsfile).

[Full documentation](https://github.com/mgasiorowski/mobile-jenkins-shared-library/blob/master/docs/README.md)

**Example Jenkinsfile**
```
#!groovy
 
@Library('jenkins-mobile-pipeline-shared-libraries') _
 
pipelineOptions{
    maxNumberBuildsToKeep = 10
}
 
checkoutScm {
    nodeLabel = 'centos_7'
}
 
reactNativeInstallDependencies {
    nodeLabel = 'centos_7'
    dependencyInstallationCommand = 'wget https://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn/releases/download/v1.1.0/yarn-1.1.0.js && export yarn="node ./yarn-1.1.0.js" && $yarn install'
}
 
reactNativeStaticAnalysis {
    nodeLabel = 'centos_7'
    staticAnalysisCommand = 'npm run lint'
}
 
reactNativeUnitTests {
    nodeLabel = 'centos_7'
    unitTestsCommand = 'npm test'
}
 
reactNativeBundleAndroidResources {
    nodeLabel = 'centos_7'
    bundleAndroidResourcesCommand = 'npm run bundle_android'
}
 
androidBetaUpload {
    nodeLabel = 'centos_7'
    stageSuffix = 'Android'
    isReactNative = 'true'
    gradleTasksDebug = 'clean assembleRelease crashlyticsUploadDistributionRelease'
}
 
iosBuild {
    nodeLabel = 'mac_mini_wp'
    stageSuffix = 'iOS'
    isReactNative = 'true'
    fastlaneLane = 'adhoc'
}

```

**This will generate pipeline like this**
